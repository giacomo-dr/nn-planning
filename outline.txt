Files outline:


General purpose
---------------

base64.cpp
base64.h
    Base64 encoding/decoding

svg_writer.cpp
svg_writer.h
    Definitions: SVGWriter
    General purpose SVG file writer

pid_controller.cpp
pid_controller.h
    Definitions: PIDController
    Generic PID controller


Project specific (from less specific to most specific)
------------------------------------------------------

geometry.h
    Definitions: Point2D, Point3D, WaypointPath2D

robot_task.h
    Definitions: RobotTask
    A RobotTask is the virtual base class for a specific task that a robot performs

robot_task_driver.h
    Definition: RobotTaskDriver
    A RobotTaskDriver takes a RobotTask and runs it into the VRep environment. It runs the
    simulation loop and react to sigint signals for premature termination.

traversability_graph.cpp:
traversability_graph.h:
    Definitions: TraversabilityGraph
    Holds precomputed traversability information for a given height map.

height_map.cpp
height_map.h
    Definitions: HeightMap
    Holds a bitmap representation of an height map. Depends on Point2D

path_follower.cpp
path_follower.h
    Definitions: PIDPathFollower
    Drives a robot along a path defined by waypoints using a PID controller. Depends on PIDController

path_planner.cpp
path_planner.h
    Definitions: RRTNode, RRTPlan, RRTPlanner
    Finds paths through a map using an RRT. Depends on Point2D, WaypointPath2D, HeightMap

vrep_client.cpp
vrep_client.h
    Definitions: VRepClient
    General purpose interface to the VRep server. Depends on Point3D

manta_controller.cpp
manta_controller.h
    Definitions: MantaController
    Interface specific for the manta vehicle. Depends on VRepClient

svg_utils.cpp
svg_utils.h
    Definitions: initialize_svg_writer(), write_height_map(), write_rrt_plan(), write_path()
    SVG functions to write project specific objects. Depends on SVGWriter

path_following_task.cpp
path_following_task.h
    Definitions: PathFollowingTask
    Moves the manta vehicle through a waypoint.
    Implements RobotTask, depends on MantaController, WaypointPath2D, PIDPathFollower

reach_target_task.cpp
reach_target_task.h
    Definitions: ReachTargetTask
    Given a Map, a start point and an end point, computes a suitable path
    and drives the manta vehicle through it. Implements RobotTask, depends on
    HeightMap, RRTPlanner, PathFollowingTask, MantaController.

executor-path.cpp
    Main driver that executes a PathFollowingTask

executor-planner.cpp
    Main driver that executes a ReachTargetTask
